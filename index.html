I am listed as a coauthor on more than 300 published journal articles. Links to all of these articles can be found here on the Inspire HEP webiste <a href="inspirehep.net/authors/1716524">here</a><br>
The sections below summarize some of my most important articles, as well as the role I played in the project.



I have been the primary author on several experimental particle physics projects:<br>

<h1> An Upper Limit on &pi;<sub>1</sub>(1600) Photoproduction Cross Section:</h1><br>

My contributions: This is the main project I have worked on as a postdoctoral researcher. I performed all of the data analysis and wrote the majority of the final published paper.<br>

This paper sets the first upper limits on the photoproduction cross section of hybrid mesons.<br>

<h1> Search for X(3872)&rarr;&pi;<sup>0</sup>&chi;<sub>c0</sub> and X(3872)&rarr;&pi;&pi;&chi;<sub>c0</sub> at BESIII</h1><br>

My contribution: This was my thesis project for graduate school. I performed all analysis work and wrote the entirety of the paper. <br>

This paper searches for new decays of an exotic strongly interacting particle.<br>
